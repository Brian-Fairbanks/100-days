    <p>
      Schools of fish and other flocking schemes are called boids, and since the 80s, there have been scientists looking into the patterns that they follow
    </p>
    <p>
      there are 3 main things that they do to form schools:
      <ul>
        <li>following the average of those nearby (Alignment)</li>
        <li> trying to get into the center of the school(cohesion)</li>
        <li>trying to not crowd in too closely to others (seperation)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      so this program gives those 3 simulations, and a slider to set the priority of each rule
    </p>
